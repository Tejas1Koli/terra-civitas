# Git Workflow - Branch Management Guide

## What Just Happened âœ…

You successfully:
1. âœ… Created a new feature branch: `feature/auth-and-ml-optimization`
2. âœ… Pushed the branch to GitHub without conflicts
3. âœ… The branch was merged to main via GitHub Pull Request
4. âœ… Updated your local main branch with the latest changes

## Current Status

```
Branch Status:
* main (up to date with origin/main)
  - Contains: auth system + ML optimizations + video streaming
  
* feature/auth-and-ml-optimization (merged to main)
  - Pushed to origin/feature/auth-and-ml-optimization
```

## Why Use Feature Branches?

âœ… **No Conflicts** - Work on features independently
âœ… **Code Review** - Review changes via Pull Request before merging
âœ… **History** - Keep git history clean and organized
âœ… **Collaboration** - Multiple developers can work simultaneously
âœ… **Easy Rollback** - Revert entire features if needed

## Common Git Workflow Steps

### 1. Create a New Feature Branch (for future features)
```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main           # Get latest
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

### 2. Work on Your Feature
```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "feat: description of changes"
git push -u origin feature/your-feature-name
```

### 3. Create Pull Request on GitHub
- Go to: https://github.com/Tejas1Koli/terra-civitas
- Click "Compare & pull request"
- Add description and submit

### 4. Merge (after code review)
**Option A: Merge via GitHub UI (Recommended)**
- Click "Merge pull request" on GitHub
- This creates a merge commit with history

**Option B: Merge via Command Line**
```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git merge feature/your-feature-name
git push origin main
```

### 5. Clean Up (Optional)
```bash
# Delete local branch
git branch -d feature/your-feature-name

# Delete remote branch
git push origin --delete feature/your-feature-name
```

## Current Branch Info

```bash
# Check all branches
git branch -a

# Check tracking info
git branch -vv

# See commit history
git log --graph --oneline --all -10
```

## Handling Conflicts During Merge

If conflicts occur:

1. **Identify conflicts**:
   ```bash
   git status
   ```

2. **View conflicting files** - They'll be marked with `<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`

3. **Resolve conflicts**:
   - Edit files manually, keep the code you want
   - Remove conflict markers

4. **Complete merge**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "resolve: merge conflicts from feature/branch"
   git push origin main
   ```

## Best Practices

âœ… **Use descriptive branch names**: `feature/`, `bugfix/`, `hotfix/`
âœ… **Write clear commit messages**: Describe what AND why
âœ… **Pull before pushing**: `git pull origin branch-name`
âœ… **Review before merging**: Check changes carefully
âœ… **Keep branches short-lived**: Merge within days, not weeks
âœ… **One feature per branch**: Makes reverting easier

## Quick Reference

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `git checkout -b branch-name` | Create & switch to new branch |
| `git push -u origin branch-name` | Push new branch to GitHub |
| `git pull origin main` | Get latest changes from main |
| `git merge feature/branch` | Merge feature into current branch |
| `git branch -d branch-name` | Delete local branch |
| `git push origin --delete branch-name` | Delete remote branch |

## Your Current Repository Status

```
âœ… main branch: Up to date
   - Auth system working
   - ML optimization complete
   - Video streaming integrated

âœ… Remote branches pushed to GitHub
   - No conflicts
   - All changes preserved
```

## Next Steps

When you have new features:
1. Create new branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature`
2. Make changes and commit
3. Push: `git push -u origin feature/your-feature`
4. Create Pull Request on GitHub
5. Merge after review

**No work will be lost - branches preserve all history!** ðŸŽ‰
